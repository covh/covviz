# covviz interactive notebooks

There is a shortcut script to start the `jupyter notebook` server locally, see `./jup.sh`.

Some of these notebooks are still useful, e.g.

* risklayer-pandas.ipynb --> see [risklayer-data.html](https://covh.github.io/cov19de/pages/risklayer-data.html) <-- interactive notebook available online via mybinder.org !
* **populationDensity.ipynb** --> RUNS IN YOUR BROWSER! via [mybinder.org service](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/covh/covviz/master?filepath=notebooks%2FpopulationDensity.ipynb) ... so cool.

Most of these notebooks in this folder however, were just intermediate steps, and probably stopped working by now.
